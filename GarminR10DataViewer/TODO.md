Random notes on things to consider doing to improve this project:
- 
	- - Replace the Bluetooth library: https://github.com/dotnet-bluetooth-le/dotnet-bluetooth-le or https://github.com/inthehand/32feet
- Test Bluetooh on Android
- Replace Protobuf library with Maui compatible library: https://github.com/protobuf-net/protobuf-net
- E6 workaround - Would this even work outside of Windows?
- Data import/export - More formats? 
- More launch monitor connections? 
- Improve ML, better data?
- Rename projects/libraries
- Document
- Connection handling of device that is turned off
